# Logistic-regression
As a part of the Jovian course: Deep Learning with PyTorch, I've done a small linear regression project to predict if a candy is chocolate or not based on its other characteristics 

The dataset I've worked with is available for free on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking
